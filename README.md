# Big Human code challenge

## Installation:

> git clone git@github.com:meganwalter/social-app-project.git
> cd social-app-project
> npm install
> npm run start-js

Note, I ran across a CORS issue with the API and used [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) to temporarily resolve for development.


## Notes:

### Middleware:

I decided to go with redux-promise over thunk because I'm more familiar with it, but in the future I would want to look into thunk and use it.

### Comments Form:

I also decided to go with redux-form as it is tech that I've used before, but would be open to re-writing in just react.

### Styling:

I used some very basic sass, flexbox and BEM based on the advanced css course I'm currently taking, I am looking forward to learning more in this course and making my sass cleaner and using more of its techniques like functions and mixins.

### My React Components:

I would probably work with my comments form to separate into container components and presentational components.

### Redux:

To improve on the current application I would have structured my actions more like [this](https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions)

### Thank you

Thank you for taking the time to review this project, I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback.
